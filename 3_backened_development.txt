1. **Define the Chatbot Logic:**
    - The chatbot will ask the user to enter his/her name.
        - Understanding the answer (NLP), the chatbot will greet the user.
        - The user can ask the chatbot atmost 3 questions in a conversational flow:
            - What is your name?
            - What is your age?
            - What is your hobby?
            - For any other question, the chatbot will reply with a default answer.
        - The chatbot will answer the questions asked by the user.
        - After answering the questions, the chatbot will end the session.

2. **Choose a Backend Technology:**
   - Python with Flask

3. **Set Up the Development Environment:**
   - Install Python - Done
   - Create environment - Done
   - Install Flask - Done
   - Create a Flask project:
    - \env -  for environment file
    - \static - for css, js, image files
    - \templates - for the html file
    - app.py - the main code file
   - run app.py on powershell
   - go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in the browser - the app is running there 

4. **Integrate Natural Language Processing (NLP):**
   - Integrate the NLP library - spaCy - Done

    - Perform basic greeting - Done

         [5. **Implement User Authentication:**
            - If your chatbot requires user-specific data or features, implement user authentication to secure access to certain functionalities.] - Not required as of now

      [6. **Database Integration:**
         - Using SQLlite
         - pip install sqlite3] - Not required as of now

7. **Implement Chatbot Logic:**
   - Write code to handle incoming user messages.
   - Implement the chatbot logic to understand user intent, process queries, and generate responses.
   - Maintain context and conversation history for a more natural interaction.

8. **Connect to External Services (Optional):**
   - If your chatbot needs to interact with external services, APIs, or databases, implement the necessary connections.

9. **Testing:**
   - Test your chatbot backend thoroughly. Consider unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing to ensure all components work together seamlessly.

10. **Deployment:**
    - Deploy your chatbot backend to a server or cloud platform. Common choices include AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku.

11. **Monitor and Maintain:**
    - Implement logging and monitoring to track usage, errors, and performance.
    - Regularly update and maintain your chatbot to improve its capabilities and fix any issues.

12. **Documentation:**
    - Provide documentation for developers who might work on or integrate with your chatbot.

Remember that the steps may vary depending on the specific requirements of your chatbot and the technologies you choose. Additionally, if you're building a chatbot for a specific platform (e.g., Facebook Messenger, Slack), you may need to follow their guidelines and use their APIs.
 Database Integration
   - Choose and set up your database.
   - Implement basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
   - Test data storage and retrieval.
