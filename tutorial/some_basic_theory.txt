Bag of words - a text representation technique that describes the occurrence of words within a document. It involves two things: a vocabulary of known words and a measure of the presence of known words. It is called a "bag" of words, because any information about the order or structure of words in the document is discarded. The model is only concerned with whether known words occur in the document, not where in the document. The bag-of-words model is commonly used in methods of document classification, where the frequency of each word is used as a feature for training a classifier. 

Tokenization - the process of breaking a stream of text up into words, phrases, symbols, or other meaningful elements called tokens. The list of tokens becomes input for further processing such as parsing or text mining. Tokenization is useful both in linguistics (where it is a form of text segmentation), and in computer science, where it forms part of lexical analysis.

Stemming - the process of reducing inflected (or sometimes derived) words to their word stem, base or root formâ€”generally a written word form. The stem need not be identical to the morphological root of the word; it is usually sufficient that related words map to the same stem, even if this stem is not in itself a valid root. Algorithms for stemming have been studied in computer science since the 1960s. Many search engines treat words with the same stem as synonyms as a kind of query expansion, a process called conflation.
